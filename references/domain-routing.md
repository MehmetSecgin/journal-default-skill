# Domain Routing Hints

Use these lightweight heuristics to reduce routing ambiguity.

## engineering
Keywords: build, test, ci, deploy, bug, code, repo, branch, gradle, npm, docker, architecture

## personal
Keywords: routine, health, relationships, life planning, personal decision, habits

## ops
Keywords: incident, alert, runbook, on-call, outage, SLO, reliability, production

## general
Use when mixed or unclear. Re-route later if the task becomes clearly scoped.
